What's a Scheme?
================

* Scheme is a dialect of LISP
* Development is documented in "The Lambda Papers" (1975-1980)
* Has had many standardization efforts, the latest R5RS (1998) and R6RS (2007).

Alas:
=====

Alas: Scheme has the unhappy distinction of being the world's most unportable programming language. It is almost misleading to call Scheme a "programming language;" it would be more accurate to characterise Scheme as a family of dialects, all loosely related by the common features of lexical scope, dynamic typing, list structure, higher-order functions, proper tail-recursion, garbage collection, macros, and (some form of) s-expression based lexical syntax.
